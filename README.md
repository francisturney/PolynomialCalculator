Welome to PolynomialCalculator
====================

QtGui

This was a project for class in which I created a polynomial calculator in command line form,
and augmented it with a GUI plotting screen.

The top-left box is the command line and the bottom-left box is the output.

Usage

For any file you are given a set of empty polynomials a-z. 

In order to set the any of the polynomials use "let f = " and then your polynomial,
with terms separated by " + " or " - " and individual terms of the form n/dX^np/dp in which
n is the numerator of your coefficient d is the denominator of your coefficient x is
the variable and np and dp are the numerator and denominator of your power respectively.

Ex. "let f = x^2 + 1/3x - x^-1/3"

To add, subtract, multiply, and take the derivative use the "let" function to assign the product 
of an operation to a polynomial. 

Ex. "let f = a + b", "let f = f' " in which " ' " is the derivative operator

To plot select the polynomial from the pull down menu above the chart.
